## Overview

This project is a music recommender system using a content-based approach. It evaluates two approaches, with high-level semantic data and low-level audio features to recommend music using the Million Songs Dataset.

The project includes code for: 
- data extraction
- data cleaning
- data transformation
- Similarity calculations using multiple approaches (cosine and euclidean)
- KNN (matching users to music tracks)
- Retrieval and presentation of recommendations
- Evaluation of model and system performance

Its approach is influenced heavily based on: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257160450_Semantic_audio_content-based_music_recommendation_and_visualization_based_on_user_preference_examples
